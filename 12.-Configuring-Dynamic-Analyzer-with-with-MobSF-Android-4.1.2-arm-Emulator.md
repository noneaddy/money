### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer with with MobSF Android 4.1.2 arm Emulator
> **This method is not Supported Now**
* Make sure [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is installed and an AVD is created. (Nexus 5 with Lollipop image is recommended) 
* Extract [MobSF_ARM_Emulator.zip](https://goo.gl/LRrGs3)
* Run `scripts/mobsfy_AVD.py` script and specify the directory that contains the files extracted from `MobSF_ARM_Emulator.zip`.
* In `MobSF/settings.py`, set `ANDROID_DYNAMIC_ANALYZER = "MobSF_AVD"`
* This will configure MobSF to use Android arm Emulator for Dynamic Analysis.

#### Manual Configuration (not recommended)
* If `mobsfy_AVD.py` script is not running successfully, you need to set the values for `AVD_EMULATOR` and `AVD_PATH` in `MobSF/settings.py` manually.
*  Follow the README inside the emulator zip and change all the path fields according to your system
* edit `MobSF/settings.py` and modify
```
AVD_EMULATOR = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Android/sdk/tools/emulator'
# This can be /Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator for newer versions of android SDK
 AVD_PATH = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/.android/avd'  # Path to the avd folder where you extracted the emulator
```
* In `MobSF/settings.py`, set `ANDROID_DYNAMIC_ANALYZER = "MobSF_AVD"`
