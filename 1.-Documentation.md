***

## Requirements

#### Static Analysis
* Git, Python **3.6+**, JDK 8+
* Mac OS users, install [command-line tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/). OS Mojave and above, install headers:
```bash
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```
* Ubuntu/Debian based Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip python3-dev build-essential \
libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev wkhtmltopdf
```
* Windows users, install [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16) and [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1d.exe)
* Windows App Static analysis requires a Windows Host or Windows VM for Mac and Linux. [More Info](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/blob/master/install/windows/readme.md)
 
**NOTE:**
* Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
* iOS IPA Analysis works only on **Mac, Linux and Docker containers**.

#### Dynamic Analysis
* [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
./setup.sh # For Linux and Mac
setup.bat # For Windows
```

**Tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu (18.04, 19.04) , OS Mojave**

> If you need Dynamic Analysis do not setup MobSF inside a Virtual Machine.

##### PDF Report Generation

* You need to install `wkhtmltopdf` binary separately for generating PDF reports.
* Check [wkhtmltopdf downloads](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) and 
[Installing wkhtmltopdf wiki](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Installing-wkhtmltopdf) for more information.
* In Windows, you need to add the folder that contains `wkhtmltopdf` binary to environment variable PATH.

### Running MobSF

* For Linux and Mac: `./run.sh` 
* For Windows: `run.bat` 

You can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to access MobSF web interface.

### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer

**Run a Genymotion Android VM before starting MobSF.** Everything will be configured automatically at runtime. MobSF requires Genymotion Android x86 VMs version 4.1 to 9.0 for dynamic analysis. We recommend using Android 7.0 and above.

Android versions 5 and above are automatically MobSFyed on first run. For Android versions less than 5, you must MobSFy the Android Runtime prior to Dynamic Analysis for the first time. Click **MobSFy Android Runtime** button in Dynamic Analysis page to MobSFy the android runtime environment.

**HTTPS Proxy**

* For Android versions 4.4 - 9.0, global proxy settings are automatically applied at runtime.
* For Android version 4.1 - 4.3, set Android VM proxy as displayed in Dynamic Analysis page.

If Dynamic Analyzer doesn't detect your android device, you need to manually configure `ANALYZER_IDENTIFIER` in _MobSF/settings.py_. Example: `ANALYZER_IDENTIFIER = '192.168.56.101:5555'`.
You can find the Android Device IP from the Genymotion title bar and the default port is 5555.

### MobSF Docker Container

> Lazy to setup MobSF?
Use the latest MobSF docker image. Dynamic Analysis is not supported
```
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
# Static Analysis Only
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

### MobSF e-Learning Courses & Certification

We have 2 self paced e-learning courses that covers MobSF and other Android Security tools
* [OpSecX - Automated Mobile Application Security Assessment with MobSF – MAS (Currently being updated)](https://opsecx.com/index.php/product/automated-mobile-application-security-assessment-with-mobsf/)
* [OpSecX - Android Security Tools Expert – ATX](https://opsecx.com/index.php/product/android-security-tools-expert-atx/)

### Updating MobSF

If you are updating MobSF, In most cases you might have to perform database migrations or you will see errors such as
```
[ERROR] Saving to DB (E:\Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF\StaticAnalyzer\views\android\db_interaction.py,
 LINE 236 "static_db.save()"): table StaticAnalyzer_staticanalyzerandroid has no column named 
```

Run the below command to migrate your db
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations StaticAnalyzer
python manage.py migrate
```

If the above changes didn't work, you might have to run  `setup.sh` or `setup.bat` again which will delete your previous scan results.

### APKiD

APKiD is disabled by default. Follow instructions here: https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD to install it and set `APKID_ENABLED` to `True` in `MobSF/settings.py`.

### VirusTotal Scan

VirusTotal Scan is disabled by default. You need to add your VirusTotal API Key before enabling it.

* Get VirusTotal API Key [here](https://www.virustotal.com/#/join-us)
* Access your API Key from https://www.virustotal.com/en/user/[username]/apikey/.

In `MobSF/settings.py`, add your API Key to `VT_API_KEY` and set `VT_ENABLED` to `True`.

### Mass Static Analysis

MobSF supports mass static analysis:
