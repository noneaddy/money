**NOTE**: If face any issues, download and install the latest python 2.7.

#### Unix
`pip install -r requirements.txt --user`

If you plan to use Windows App Static analysis, you need additional configuration in Unix based OS.
For Windows App Static Analysis, Please read [Windows App Static Analysis](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/blob/master/install/windows/readme.md) 

##### PDF Report Generation

* You need to install `wkhtmltopdf` binary separately for generating PDF reports.
* Check [wkhtmltopdf downloads](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) and 
[Installing wkhtmltopdf wiki](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Installing-wkhtmltopdf) for more information.
* In Windows, you need to add `wkhtmltopdf` binary to PATH.
## Running MobSF

`python manage.py runserver`

If you need to run on a specific port number try  `python manage.py runserver PORT_NO`
To expose MobSF to a particular IP, you can try `python manage.py runserver IP:PORT_NO`

If everything goes right, you will get an output like the one below.

## Configuring Dynamic Analyzer

MobSF Dynamic Analysis currently supports Android and can be done in three ways.

1. [Dynamic Analysis with MobSF supplied Android VM (Works for most apps)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation#configuring-dynamic-analyzer-with-mobsf-android-vm)
2. [Dynamic Analysis using a Rooted Android Device (Works for all the apps)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation#configuring-dynamic-analyzer-with-rooted-android-device)
3. [Dynamic Analysis using a Rooted Android VM (not tested)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation#configuring-dynamic-analyzer-with-rooted-custom-vm)

### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer with MobSF Android VM

Dynamic Anlayzer is available only for Android binaries (APK) and works only if your computer has at least 4GB of RAM and Full Virtualization support.

To Configure Dynamic Analyzer we need 4 things.
* VM UUID
* Snapshot UUID
* Host/Proxy IP
* VM/Device IP
 
#### Steps to Follow

* Open VirtualBox, Go to **File -> Import Appliance** and select the MobSF_VM_X.X.ova file.
  
  ![Importing MobSF VM ova file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9768972/cbdd115e-5744-11e5-88dc-bf280df3a963.png)

* Proceed with the import process. Do not alter anything.
* Once the OVA is Imported Successfully, you will see a new entry in VirtualBox named MobSF_VM_X.X
* Right Click MobSF VM and Choose Settings, Go to Network tab. Here we need to configure two Network Adapters.
  
  * **Adapter** 1 should be enabled and attached to **Host-only Adapter**. Remember the name of the adapter. We need the name to Identify the Host/Proxy IP.
    
    ![Adapter 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769043/2852d5b8-5745-11e5-9da4-0d76c18ecc3b.png)
  
  * **Adapter 2** should be enabled and attached to **NAT**
    
    ![Adapter 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769162/14556a70-5746-11e5-8d76-ce8d6d200167.png)

* Save the settings and Start MobSF VM. While the VM is Booting up. Note down the **VM IP**.
  
  ![VM IP](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769219/794771da-5746-11e5-9d81-5549422aac71.png)
* Once the VM Boots up, It will present a Lock Screen. The password for the Lock Screen is `1234`
  
  ![MobSF VM](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769278/c35e0f90-5746-11e5-9d07-75c1c63e8cdb.png)
  
  **NOTE**: If the VM does not boot up properly then you cannot perform Dynamic Analysis with MobSF VM.
* **Getting the Host/Proxy IP**
  * **Windows** : Issue the command `ipconfig` in command prompt and note down the IP corresponding to the name of the Host-only Adapter.

    ![ipconfig example windows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769557/8fdcf3d2-5748-11e5-905e-927159ea525b.png)

  * **Unix** : Issue the command `ifconfig` in terminal and note down the IP corresponding to the name of the Host-only Adapter.

    ![ifconfig example in mac](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769553/88bb329e-5748-11e5-9e91-3d14db839771.png)
    
   **NOTE**: The VirtualBox Host-Only Adapter IP and MobSF VM IP should be in the same network range. If your MobSF VM IP and Adapter IP are in different network range, modify the Adapter IP to be in the same network range as that of MobSF VM IP. 

   See: [What to do when MobSF VM and VirtualBox Host Only Adapter are not in the same network range](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/6.-What-to-do-when-MobSF-VM-and-VirtualBox-Host-Only-Adapter-are-not-in-the-same-network-range)
* Go to Wi-Fi Settings in **MobSF VM** and set the Proxy IP as the Host/Proxy IP which you have obtained from the previous step and port no as `1337`.

  ![Proxy Settings in VM](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769738/92961788-5749-11e5-98ac-26488ca46516.png)

* Save the settings and Navigate to the Home Screen of  **MobSF VM**. Wait for 30 seconds and save a snapshot of the **MobSF VM** in VirtualBox

  ![Saving MobSF VM Snapshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769841/26555556-574a-11e5-9de2-c7eb8b0f30bf.png)

* Once the Snapshot is saved, right click **MobSF VM** and select `Show in Explorer` or `Show in Finder`.
 
 ![Show VM Files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769901/83c30b3e-574a-11e5-8f90-6ac02732429a.png)

* Open the File **MobSF_VM_X.X.vbox** in any Text Editor and note down the VM UUID and Snapshot UUID

 ![Getting VM UUID and Snapshot UUID](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769959/e9d9bb0c-574a-11e5-8005-730306445be9.png) 
  
  Here the value of `uuid` is the **VM UUID** and `currentSnapshot` is the **Snapshot UUID**.

* Now we have all the things needed to configure the Dynamic Analyzer (Host/Proxy IP, VM IP, VM UUID and Snapshot UUID)

* Go to `MobSF/settings.py` and set the appropriate values as

  * UUID = VM UUID
  * SUUID = Snapshot UUID
  * VM_IP = VM IP
  * PROXY_IP = Host/Proxy IP 
  
* A sample configuration is shown below

  ![Settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/13612465/ab731dfa-e58d-11e5-9b07-9c736266de23.png)
  
* Finally start the server.

### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer with Rooted Android Device

   * MobSFy the Rooted Android Device, Follow the instructions here: [Configure MobSF Dynamic Analysis Environment in Android Device](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/2.-Configure-MobSF-Dynamic-Analysis-Environment-in-your-Android-Device-or-VM)
  * In **MobSF/settings.py**, set `REAL_DEVICE` to `True`
  * Set `DEVICE_IP` and `DEVICE_ADB_PORT` with the IP and PORT that you got from WiFi ADB
  * Sample configuration will look like this.
    ![Dynamic Analysis on Android Device](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/13613825/b0e84e26-e593-11e5-8174-4c9f6ae37a41.png)

### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer with Rooted Custom VM

  * MobSFy the Custom VM, Follow the instructions here: [Configure MobSF Dynamic Analysis Environment in Custom VM](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/2.-Configure-MobSF-Dynamic-Analysis-Environment-in-your-Android-Device-or-VM)
  *  **VM on Virtual Box**: If the VM is hosted on VirtualBox, follow the same steps that you have followed for configuring [MobSF VM](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation#configuring-dynamic-analyzer-with-mobsf-android-vm) and set appropriate `VM  UUID`, `Snapshot UUID`, `Host/Proxy IP`, and `VM/Device IP`. Also make sure that `REAL_DEVICE` is set to `False`
  * **Any Other VM**: Configure it as a Real device. Set `REAL_DEVICE` to `True` and specify `DEVICE_IP`and `DEVICE_ADB_PORT`. Snapshot feature is only available with VM(s) hosted in VirtualBox.

## Updating MobSF

If you are updating MobSF, In most cases you might have to perform database migrations or you will see errors such as
```
[ERROR] Saving to DB (E:\Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF\StaticAnalyzer\views\android\db_interaction.py, LINE 236 "static_db.save()"): table StaticAnalyzer_staticanalyzerandroid has no column named 
```

Run the below command to migrate your db
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

If the above changes didn't work, you might need to delete the file `db.sqlite3`, or run `clean.sh` in Mac/Linux. After that run the above commands.

NOTE: This will remove the previously saved MobSF scan results.
