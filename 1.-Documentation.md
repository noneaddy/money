***

## Requirements

### Static Analysis
* Python 3.6 or above
* Oracle JDK 1.7 or above
* Mac OS Users must install Command-line tools - [How to Install Commandline Tools in Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)
* iOS IPA Analysis works only on Mac and Linux.
* Windows App Static analysis requires a Windows Host or Windows VM for Mac and Linux. [More Info](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/blob/master/install/windows/readme.md)
 
**NOTE:**
* On Linux and Mac, install Oracle Java 1.7 or above and **make it the default** one.

### Dynamic Analysis
* Download MobSF Android x86 4.4.2 VM (v0.3) ova file: [Download](https://goo.gl/QxgHZa)
* Oracle VirtualBox (if you are using x86 VM) - [Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).


## Installation

### Run MobSF Docker image

> Lazy to setup Static Analysis?
Use the latest MobSF docker image. (Dynamic analysis mostly need you to configure MobSF in host OS than inside a container.) 

```
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

### Configuring Static Analyzer

**Tested on Windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10), Kali (2016.2), Ubuntu (14.04, 16.04) , OSX (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan), OS (Sierra, High Sierra)**

> If you need Dynamic Analysis do not setup MobSF inside a VM or use Docker, set it up in your Host OS.

```
git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
./setup.sh # For Linux and Mac
setup.bat # For Windows
```

##### PDF Report Generation

* You need to install `wkhtmltopdf` binary separately for generating PDF reports.
* Check [wkhtmltopdf downloads](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) and 
[Installing wkhtmltopdf wiki](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Installing-wkhtmltopdf) for more information.
* In Windows, you need to add the folder that contains `wkhtmltopdf` binary to environment variable PATH.

### Running MobSF

* For Linux and Mac: `./run.sh` 
* For Windows: `run.bat` 

You can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to access the MobSF web interface.

### Configuring Dynamic Analyzer

MobSF Dynamic Analysis currently supports Android and can be done in four ways.

1. [Dynamic Analysis with MobSF Android 4.4.2 x86 VirtualBox VM - **default** (Fast, not all Apps work)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/11.-Configuring-Dynamic-Analyzer-with-MobSF-Android-4.4.2-x86-VirtualBox-VM)
2. [Dynamic Analysis with MobSF Android 4.1.2 arm Emulator - (Slow, Most Apps work)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/12.-Configuring-Dynamic-Analyzer-with-with-MobSF-Android-4.1.2-arm-Emulator) (**Not Supported Anymore**)
3. [Dynamic Analysis using a Rooted Android 4.03 - 4.4 Device (Very Fast, All Apps work)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/13.-Configuring-Dynamic-Analyzer-with-Rooted-Android-4.03---4.4-Device)
4. [Dynamic Analysis using a Rooted Android 4.03 - 4.4 VM (not tested)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/14.-Configuring-Dynamic-Analyzer-with-Rooted-Android-4.03---4.4-VM)

## Updating MobSF

If you are updating MobSF, In most cases you might have to perform database migrations or you will see errors such as
```
[ERROR] Saving to DB (E:\Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF\StaticAnalyzer\views\android\db_interaction.py, LINE 236 "static_db.save()"): table StaticAnalyzer_staticanalyzerandroid has no column named 
```

Run the below command to migrate your db
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

If the above changes didn't work, you might have to run `clean.sh`(present in `scripts`) in Mac/Linux. After that run the above commands.

NOTE: This will remove the previously saved MobSF scan results.

***
## Disabled Components

Some components are disabled by default as they are experimental 

### VirusTotal

VirusTotal Scan is disabled by default. You need to add your VirusTotal API Key before enabling it. If you don't have an API Key, Register [here](https://www.virustotal.com/#/join-us) and access your API Key from https://www.virustotal.com/en/user/[username]/apikey/.
In `settings.py`, add your API Key to `VT_API_KEY` and set `VT_ENABLED` to `True`.

## Mass Static Analysis

MobSF supports mass static analysis:
