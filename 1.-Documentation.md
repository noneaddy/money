* iOS IPA binary analysis requires MAC OS X and you need to install Command-line tools for MAC OS X 
[http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)
* Hardware Requirements: Min 4GB RAM and 5GB HDD.

**NOTE:**
* On Linux and Mac, install Oracle Java 1.7 or above and **make it the default** one.

##Download

* Download latest release of MobSF: [https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/releases](https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/releases)
* Download MobSF VM 0.2 ova file: [https://goo.gl/h7CCxx](https://goo.gl/h7CCxx)

##Installation
**Tested on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Ubuntu, OSX Mavericks**

* **Windows**: Extract the MobSF compressed file to C:\MobSF
* **Mac**: Extract MobSF compressed file to /Users/[username]/MobSF
* **Linux**: Extract MobSF compressed file to /home/[username]/MobSF

## Configuring Static Analyzer

Install MobSF Python dependencies using **pip**

#### Windows
`C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt`

**NOTE**: If pip.exe is not available in Scripts directory, Download and Re-install latest Python2.7.

#### Unix
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running MobSF

`python manage.py runserver`

If you need to run on a specific port number try  `python manage.py runserver PORT_NO`

If everything goes right, you will get an output like the one below.

## Configuring Dynamic Analyzer

### Configuring MobSF VM with the Dynamic Analyzer

Dynamic Anlayzer is available only for Android binaries (APK) and works only if your computer has at least 4GB of RAM and Full Virtualization support.

To Configure Dynamic Analyzer we need 4 things.
* VM UUID
* Snapshot UUID
* Host/Proxy IP
* VM/Device IP
 
### Steps to Follow

* Open VirtualBox, Go to **File -> Import Appliance** and select the MobSF_VM_X.X.ova file.
  
  ![Importing MobSF VM ova file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9768972/cbdd115e-5744-11e5-88dc-bf280df3a963.png)

* Proceed with the import process. Do not alter anything.
* Once the OVA is Imported Successfully, you will see a new entry in VirtualBox named MobSF_VM_X.X
* Right Click MobSF VM and Choose Settings, Go to Network tab. Here we need to configure two Network Adapters.
  
  * **Adapter** 1 should be enabled and attached to **Host-only Adapter**. Remember the name of the adapter. We need the name to Identify the Host/Proxy IP.
    
    ![Adapter 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769043/2852d5b8-5745-11e5-9da4-0d76c18ecc3b.png)
  
  * **Adapter 2** should be enabled and attached to **NAT**
    
    ![Adapter 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769162/14556a70-5746-11e5-8d76-ce8d6d200167.png)

* Save the settings and Start MobSF VM. While the VM is Booting up. Note down the **VM IP**.
  
  ![VM IP](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769219/794771da-5746-11e5-9d81-5549422aac71.png)
* Once the VM Boots up, It will present a Lock Screen. The password for the Lock Screen is `1234`

  **NOTE**: If the VM does not boot up properly then you cannot perform Dynamic Analysis.
* **Getting the Host/Proxy IP**
  * **Windows** : Issue the command `ipconfig` in command prompt and note down the IP corresponding to the name of the Host-only Adapter.

    ![ipconfig example windows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769557/8fdcf3d2-5748-11e5-905e-927159ea525b.png)

  * **Unix** : Issue the command `ifconfig` in terminal and note down the IP corresponding to the name of the Host-only Adapter.

    ![ifconfig example in mac](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769553/88bb329e-5748-11e5-9e91-3d14db839771.png)
    
* Go to Wi-Fi Settings in **MobSF VM** and set the Proxy IP as the Host/Proxy IP which you have obtained from the previous step and port no as `1337`.

  ![Proxy Settings in VM](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769738/92961788-5749-11e5-98ac-26488ca46516.png)

* Save the settings and Navigate to the Home Screen of  **MobSF VM**. Wait for 30 seconds and save a snapshot of the **MobSF VM** in VirtualBox

  ![Saving MobSF VM Snapshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769841/26555556-574a-11e5-9de2-c7eb8b0f30bf.png)

* Once the Snapshot is saved, right click **MobSF VM** and select `Show in Explorer` or `Show in Finder`.
 
 ![Show VM Files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769901/83c30b3e-574a-11e5-8f90-6ac02732429a.png)

* Open the File **MobSF_VM_X.X.vbox** in any Text Editor and note down the VM UUID and Snapshot UUID

 ![Getting VM UUID and Snapshot UUID](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/9769959/e9d9bb0c-574a-11e5-8005-730306445be9.png) 
  
  Here the value of `uuid` is the **VM UUID** and `currentSnapshot` is the **Snapshot UUID**.

* Now we have all the things needed to configure the Dynamic Analyzer (Host/Proxy IP, VM IP, VM UUID and Snapshot UUID)

* Go to `MobSF/settings.py` and set the appropriate values as

  * UUID = VM UUID
  * SUUID = Snapshot UUID
  * VM_IP = VM IP
  * PROXY_IP = Host/Proxy IP 
  
* A sample configuration is shown below

  ![Settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/13612465/ab731dfa-e58d-11e5-9b07-9c736266de23.png)
  
* Finally start the server.

### Configuring Rooted Android Device/Custom VM with MobSF

* MobSFy the Android Device/Custom VM, Follow the instructions here: [Configure MobSF Dynamic Analysis Environment in your Android Device or VM](https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/2.-Configure-MobSF-Dynamic-Analysis-Environment-in-your-Android-Device-or-VM)

* For Android Device:
  
  * In **MobSF/settings.py**, set `REAL_DEVICE` to `True`
  * Set `DEVICE_IP` and `DEVICE_ADB_PORT` with the IP and PORT that you got from WiFi ADB
  * Sample configuration will look like this.
    ![Dynamic Analysis on Android Device](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4301109/13613825/b0e84e26-e593-11e5-8174-4c9f6ae37a41.png)

* For Custom Android VM
  
  *  **VM on Virtual Box**: If the VM is hosted on VirtualBox, follow the same steps that you have followed for configuring [MobSF VM](https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/1.-Documentation#configuring-mobsf-vm-with-the-dynamic-analyzer) and set appropriate `VM  UUID`, `Snapshot UUID`, `Host/Proxy IP`, and `VM/Device IP`. Also make sure that `REAL_DEVICE` is set to `False`
  * **Any Other VM**: Configure it as a Real device. Set `REAL_DEVICE` to `True` and specify `DEVICE_IP`and `DEVICE_ADB_PORT`. Snapshot feature is only available with VM(s) hosted in VirtualBox.
