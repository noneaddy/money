## Issue
For some users, the IP shown in MobSF VM and VirtualBox Host Only Adapter are in different range. For example the IP shown in MobSF VM is **_192.168.56.101_** and the IP of the VirtualBox Host Only Adapter is **_192.168.50.1_** 

**NOTE:** In Windows, VirtualBox Host Only Adapter is named like `Ethernet Adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network #1` and for OSX/Linux it will be named like `vboxnet0`. The number at the end can change for both as it depends upon the no of virtual adapters that you are using.

## Solution

The solution to this is to modify the IP of the VirtualBox Network Adapter.

1. Go to `File -> Preference` for Linux and Windows or `VirtualBox -> Preference` for OSX

2. Choose the **Network** tab and select **Host-only Networks**

3. Select the Host-only Network Adapter that you are using for MobSF and MobSF VM. and click on the settings icon

4. Go to the Adapter Tab and set the `IPv4 Address` to be in the range of MobSF VM

**For example:** If MobSF VM is running in the IP `192.168.56.101`, set the Adapter IPv4 Address as `192.168.56.1` so that both are in the same network range.
