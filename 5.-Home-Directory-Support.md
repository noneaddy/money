# Home Directory Support

To provide personalized version of MobSF to multiple users on an OS or to bundle MobSF with a pentesting distro you might need the home directory support enabled.

To enable Home Directory support, go to settings.py and set `USE_HOME` to True

`USE_HOME = True`

This will ensure

1. All the user uploads, database, and downloads are now created in `.MobSF` directory under user's home directory.
2. User configurations are read from `.MobSF/config.py` in home directory. If the format is incorrect or the file is not found, user configurations are read from `MobSF/settings.py` itself.
