## For Collaborators

* Do not submit a pull request (PR) to `master` branch or any other core development branches and merge it right away.
* PR should be merged only after peer review is done. This is to ensure code quality and integrity of the project.
* Feel free to merge the PR if none of the peers review or acknowledge your code in 5 days after the PR is submitted.
* If a review comment is added or changes are requested by a peer, then PR can be merged only after required changes are made.
* All binaries in the PR should have a publicly verifiable checksum. Mention the source in the PR description.
* Do add necessary commments so that others can work with your contribution later.
* Add unit tests if possible.
* Always run the existing unit tests and make sure your contributions won't break any existing functionality.
* Write code with multiple platform in mind. We support Windows, Mac and Linux.
