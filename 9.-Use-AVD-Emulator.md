# Overview
##  Why should I use AVD emulator rather than VirtualBox?
It's based on ARM emulation, which will probably emulate better most of the phones on the market

## So why do you support VirtualBox in the first place?
VirtualBox is a lot faster - 10x faster.

Which containts:
* Pre-Configured Nexus 5 API 16 with all the needed applications installed
* Pre-Installed custom system-image with Xposed framework installed
## Configuration
* Make sure You have installed [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjw2LjGBRDYm9jj5JSxiJcBEiQAwKWACwGMJB0-q0LTld7wTnK7-xacJXRyfEePUtF3BXs3IC8aAk4v8P8HAQ), or at least the AVD... <br/> 
* Extract the MobSF_ARM_Emulator.zip, and run the <b>mobsfy_AVD.py</b> script which is inside MobSF master
* It is highly recommended to use the interactive mobsfy_AVD script, If you do insist on manual config, follow the next section
## Manual configuration (not recommended)
*  Follow the README inside the emulator zip and change all the path fields according to your system
* edit settings.py inside the MobSF folder: <br />
#================AVD SETTINGS ===================  <br />
AVD = True  <br />
AVD_EMULATOR = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Android/sdk/tools/emulator' # This is the emulator executable (emulator.exe for windows users) <br />
 AVD_PATH = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/.android/avd'  # Path to the avd folder where you extracted the emulator <br /> AVD_REFERENCE_NAME = r'Nexus5API16' # Leave it like this <br />
 AVD_DUP_NAME = r'Nexus5API16_1' # You can name it anything you want. <br />
 AVD_ADB_PORT = 5554<br />

Special thanks goes for cuckoo-droid, I got inspierd by their code and idea for this implementation.
