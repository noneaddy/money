# Overview
##  Why should I use AVD emulator rather than VirtualBox?
It's based on ARM emulation, which will probably emulate better most of the phones on the market

## So why do you support VirtualBox in the first place?
VirtualBox is a lot faster - 10x faster.

* Follow the README inside the emulator zip and change all the path fields according to your system
* edit settings.py inside the MobSF folder: <br />
#================AVD SETTINGS ===================  <br />
AVD = True  <br />
AVD_EMULATOR = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Android/sdk/tools/emulator' # This is the emulator executable (emulator.exe for windows users) <br />
 AVD_PATH = r'/Users/[USERNAME]/.android/avd'  # Path to the avd folder where you extracted the emulator <br /> AVD_REFERENCE_NAME = r'Nexus5API16' # Leave it like this <br />
 AVD_DUP_NAME = r'Nexus5API16_1' # You can name it anything you want. <br />
